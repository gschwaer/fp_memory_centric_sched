 *  Wrapper Header File for Infineon TLE 6250GV33 Transceiver Driver.
 *
 *  \b [CanTrcv070]
 *
 *  In case different CAN transceiver hardware chips are used in one ECU,
 *  the function names of the different CAN transceiver drivers must be modified
 *  such that no two functions with the same names are generated.
 *
 *  It is the responsibility of the user to take care that no two functions with
 *  the same names are configured.
 *
 *  The names may be extended with a vendor ID or a type ID. (BSW00347)
 *
 *  \b [CanTrcv064]
 *
 *  The naming convention prescribed by AUTOSAR is applied to all files of the
 *  \c CanTrcv module. (BSW00300)
