This example measures and prints on console some metrics (e.g., task activation
time, task exit time, ISR call time) measured when ERIKA runs as a Jailhouse
inmate on a x86-64 platform.
The specific platform can be specified in the OIL file through the BOARD_DATA
field (e.g. BOARD_DATA = VBOX_3610;).
