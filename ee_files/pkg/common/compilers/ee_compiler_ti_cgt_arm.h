  TI Code Generator Tool support standard c99 _Pragma operator, so I would
  have loved to use it when available.
  Unfortunately the pragma
  to force inlining
  (#pragma FUNC_ALWAYS_INLINE( func ))
  and to prevent it 
  (#pragma FUNC_CANNOT_INLINE( func ))

  stupidly require the function name as parameter and are not applied to the
  following declaration for C files.
  This prevent us to use it in our macro and rely to GNU extension support
  implemented by the compiler (always be praised).
  The most upsetting aspect is that the pragmas behave correctly in C++. :( */
