 *  \brief  Timestamp Counter Header file used by Erika3
 *
 *  The Timestamp Counter is a 64-bit internal register which is present in
 *  all Intel processors after the Pentium.
 *  It stores the number of cycles executed by the CPU after the latest reset.
 *  The time-stamp counter can be read by software using the RDTSC instruction.
 *  Note that The APIC timer can be set to the TSC-deadline mode.
